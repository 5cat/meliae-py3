Meant to be a simple program for dumping python memory usage information to a
disk format, which can then be parsed into useful things like graph
representations.

## Code history
This repository was created from the [Meliae launchpad project](https://launchpad.net/meliae) with:

    bzr fast-export --git-branch=dev lp:~cjwatson/meliae/py3-obj-summary | GIT_DIR=meliae-py3/.git git fast-import

The [dev branch](https://github.com/cgrtrifork/meliae-py3/tree/dev) contains the state of code from the import.
